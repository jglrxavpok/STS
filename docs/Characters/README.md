# Character format
Characters are stored inside "scenes/characters/".

Each character has its own folder, and the folder name is used to identify the character inside the game code (called character ID).

## Files
- `small_icon.png`: 200x200 Thumbnail used for the character selection screen, in the grid of characters, and for the HUD during gameplay
- `icon.png`: 512x512 Thumbnail used for the selected character of a player, inside the character selection screen
- `<character_id>.tscn`: scene representing the character. Replace `<character_id>` with your character id
